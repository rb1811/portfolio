Discovering the Reflex framework and harnessing the capability of AI for implementation—was the game-changer. This portfolio is also a deliberate rejection of the 'one-page resume' tyranny and the proliferation of paid resume-builder services. It's was long due on my side to move beyond font size 9 single page resume, to showcase the full, unconstrained breadth of one's imagination and best work."

Reading books like The Richest Man in Babylon, The Psychology of Money, and Rich Dad Poor Dad has been eye-opening. The core lesson is clear: relying solely on the intense '996' work culture primarily serves to maximize the wealth of C-suite executives, often leaving me, the dedicated employee, perpetually chasing my own financial and life stability. My goal now is to establish a working relationship—whether as an employee or a freelancer—that is mutually beneficial and values my contribution as a true partner, not just a resource."

No exorbitant salary in a poorly managed city can compel me to compromise on this baseline decency. When you have the opportunity and means to build multiple income streams, you deserve to live as a human, not as a slave to location or circumstance."
