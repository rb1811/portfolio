I am Prabhat Racherla, a passionate and detail-oriented Backend Engineer with a robust history of designing, developing, and deploying scalable, high-performance server-side applications. My core preference lies with Python, but I have professionally worked with and adapted to Perl, Scala, and C# when project needs required it. My expertise spans cloud infrastructure, microservices architecture, and databases.",

Discovering the Reflex framework and harnessing the capability of AI for implementation—was the game-changer. This portfolio is also a deliberate rejection of the 'one-page resume' tyranny and the proliferation of paid resume-builder services. It's high time to move beyond font size 9, single page resume to showcase the full, unconstrained breadth of one's imagination and best work."

Inspired by foundational texts like *The Richest Man in Babylon*, *The Psychology of Money*, and *Rich Dad Poor Dad*, I've internalized the unambiguous lesson: the '996' grind serves only to make your CEO rich enough to worry about finding parking for their yacht, while you struggle to find parking for your car. We moved from black slavery 200 years ago to corporate slavery today. I wish to be an employee or a freelancer, not a chattel, and that distinction matters profoundly."

No exorbitant salary in a poorly managed city can compel me to compromise on this baseline decency. When you have the opportunity and means to build multiple income streams, you deserve to live as a human, not as a slave to location or circumstance."
